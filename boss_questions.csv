1,How would you explain the concept of recursion in programming using a real-world example?,Recursion is like Russian nesting dolls - each doll contains a smaller version of itself until you reach the smallest doll. Similarly in programming each function call contains a smaller version of the same problem.
2,You have a series: 2 5 10 17 26. What's the pattern and the next number?,The pattern is adding consecutive odd numbers (3+5+7+9). The next number is 37 because 26+11=37.
3,What is the most efficient sorting algorithm and why?,QuickSort is generally considered most efficient for large datasets with O(n log n) average case complexity and good cache performance due to its in-place partitioning.
4,What's the difference between machine learning and artificial intelligence?,AI is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks intelligently while ML is a specific subset focused on using data and algorithms to improve accuracy without explicit programming.
5,How does blockchain technology ensure security and transparency?,Blockchain uses cryptography and distributed ledger where each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block making it tamper-evident and transparent as all participants have a copy.
